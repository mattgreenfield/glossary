# Glossary

## Database
The database is hosted with Fauna which intergrates with netlify and supports GraphQL out of the box
See:
- Netlify Setup: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/09/10/announcing-the-faunadb-add-on-for-netlify/
- GraphQL docs: https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/


## Development notes:
- Too authenticate vue-apollo with Fauna, I need to add the token. See "Configuring Apollo with the Auth Token"
https://www.howtographql.com/vue-apollo/5-authentication/
Or maybe the netlify intergration has done this for me??
